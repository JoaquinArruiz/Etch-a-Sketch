# Etch-a-Sketch

Simple drawing website.

You can try the live test at: [Etch-a-Sketch Live Page](https://joaquinarruiz.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)

#### Process and Some Thoughts:
I started by trying to make the rows and the columns and was the worst part of the project, I couldn't find anything that fit what I wanted. Anyway from then on it was in free fall, all worked great.

Cool project. Learned how to use/make grids in different ways during the process

-----

#### Known Issues:   
- Sometimes you can drag the grid
- Add responsive design (you have to draw 1 cell at the time in mobile devices)
